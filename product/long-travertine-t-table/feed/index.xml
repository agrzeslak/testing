					<description><![CDATA[My partner and I originally found this table through Etsy and we fell in love with it immediately. Unfortunately due to careless delivery by the delivery company, the table arrived in pieces, however, James from Category is Stone immediately offered to refund or provide another table (with no extra charge of course). We chose to get another table because Category is Stone’s work is incredibly gorgeous and we were excited to have one of their pieces in our home. The replacement table arrived in less than two weeks and looks even better than pictured above! The store is very good with communications (James responded to all my Instagram messages within 2 hours), and their products are amazing! Definitely recommend them!]]></description>
